``scubes`` package implements a script to run the program from a CSV
file with a list of objects, a *Masterlist*. This script is called
``scubesml``

*Masterlist* is a csv text file in which one could gather information of
a list of objects to create cubes. The file must contain at least 5
columns named with the following header and information:

1. ``SNAME``: A nickname for the object
2. ``FIELD``: S-PLUS Field (TILE) in which the program will search for
   the coordinates
3. ``RA__deg``: Right-ascencion in degrees
4. ``DEC__deg``: Declination in degrees
5. ``SIZE__pix``: SIZE of the object in pixels

*Masterlist* file content example::

::

   SNAME,FIELD,RA__deg,DEC__deg,SIZE__pix
   S00001,SPLUS-s24s34,52.08196,-31.06817,53.65902
   S00002,SPLUS-s24s35,52.87771,-30.21333,25.898617
   (...)

A *Masterlist* could contain more columns and, at the end of the run,
the script will update the primary header of the output FITS file with
all information inside the *Masterlist* for the chosen object.

Size of the stamp
-----------------

For the size calculation, the script will use the value of the column
``SIZE__pix`` and also the ``--size_multiplicator`` option. At the end,
the final size value will be the next even integer of the
multiplication:

::

   size = size_multiplicator x SIZE__pix

The *Masterlist* file ``masterlist_example.csv`` contain 9 objects. To
run ``scubes`` for each object, just use ``scubesml`` script as:

.. code-block:: ipython3

    !scubesml -frR -U YOURUSER -P YOURPASS -w . --size_multiplicator 20 -- ESO419-G013 masterlist_example.csv

Header information
------------------

At this point, we can see that the *Masterlist* information is stored at
the header:

.. code-block:: ipython3

    from scubes.utilities.readscube import read_scube
    
    filename = 'ESO419-G013/ESO419-G013_cube.fits'
    scube = read_scube(filename)

Running scubes for the entire list
----------------------------------

A simple shell script could help to run ``scubes`` for the entire list
of objects. We use ``tail`` and ``cut`` shell commands in order to get
only the SNAME of the objects from the *Masterlist* file.

.. code-block:: bash

   for SNAME in `tail -n+2 masterlist_example.csv | cut -f1 -d','`
   do
       scubesml -frR -U YOURUSER -P YOURPASS --size_multiplicator 20 -- ${SNAME} masterlist_example.csv
   done
