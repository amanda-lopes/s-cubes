Getting started
===============

**S-Cubes** is a python package designed to make galaxy cubes (X, Y, Lambda) 
with S-PLUS data. The `S-Cubes repository <https://github.com/elacerda/s-cubes>`_ 
includes the `scubes` python package which allows the users to create their own
codes. It also includes the data files to calibrate stamps with iDR4 zero-points 
correction and SExtractor to identify stars along the stamp (optionally).
